## What is Aerospace?

Aerospace is a modern tiling window manager for macOS that automatically arranges your windows in a non-overlapping layout. This configuration provides a powerful, keyboard-driven workflow for managing application windows across multiple workspaces.

<Note>
  Aerospace requires macOS and must be installed separately. See the [installation guide](/installation) for setup instructions.
</Note>

## Core Philosophy

The Aerospace configuration is designed around:

- **Keyboard-first navigation**: All window management via keyboard shortcuts
- **Multiple workspaces**: 9 numbered workspaces plus 26 letter-named workspaces
- **Automatic tiling**: Windows automatically arrange without overlapping
- **Vim-style navigation**: Using `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` for directional movement

## Configuration Location

The Aerospace configuration is stored at:

```bash
~/.aerospace.toml
```

Copy the provided configuration file to this location:

```bash
cp aerospace.toml ~/.aerospace.toml
```

## Startup Behavior

### Auto-Start Configuration

```toml
# Start AeroSpace at login
start-at-login = true

# Commands to run after login
after-login-command = []

# Commands to run after AeroSpace startup
after-startup-command = []
```

Aerospace is configured to start automatically when you log into macOS. You can customize startup behavior by adding commands to `after-login-command` or `after-startup-command`.

## Layout System

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Tiles Layout">
    The default layout mode where windows are arranged in a tiled grid pattern.

    ```toml
    default-root-container-layout = 'tiles'
    ```

    - Windows automatically resize to fill available space
    - No overlapping windows
    - Clean, organized workspace
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Accordion Layout">
    An alternative layout where windows stack with padding between them.

    ```toml
    accordion-padding = 30
    ```

    - Windows have 30px padding between them
    - More visual separation than tiles
    - Toggle with `Alt + ,` (comma)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Container Orientation

```toml
# Possible values: horizontal|vertical|auto
default-root-container-orientation = 'auto'
```

<Accordion title="Understanding Auto Orientation">
  With `auto` orientation:
  - **Wide monitors** (wider than tall): Get horizontal orientation
  - **Tall monitors** (taller than wide): Get vertical orientation
  
  This ensures optimal window arrangement based on your monitor's aspect ratio.
</Accordion>

## Normalization Features

```toml
enable-normalization-flatten-containers = true
enable-normalization-opposite-orientation-for-nested-containers = true
```

<Note>
  Normalization features help maintain clean, predictable layouts by automatically:
  - Flattening unnecessary container nesting
  - Optimizing nested container orientations
</Note>

## Window Gaps

The configuration uses a **no-gap** setup for maximum screen space:

```toml
[gaps]
inner.horizontal = 0
inner.vertical =   0
outer.left =       0
outer.bottom =     0
outer.top =        0
outer.right =      0
```

<Accordion title="Customizing Gaps">
  You can add spacing between windows by modifying the gaps:

  ```toml
  [gaps]
  inner.horizontal = 10  # Space between windows horizontally
  inner.vertical =   10  # Space between windows vertically
  outer.left =       10  # Space from left monitor edge
  outer.bottom =     10  # Space from bottom monitor edge
  outer.top =        10  # Space from top monitor edge
  outer.right =      10  # Space from right monitor edge
  ```
</Accordion>

## Mouse Behavior

```toml
on-focused-monitor-changed = ['move-mouse monitor-lazy-center']
on-focus-changed = "move-mouse window-lazy-center"
```

The mouse cursor automatically follows focus:
- When you switch monitors, the cursor moves to the center of that monitor
- When you focus a different window, the cursor moves to that window's center

<Warning>
  If you prefer manual mouse control, remove these lines from your configuration.
</Warning>

## Keyboard Layout

```toml
key-mapping.preset = 'qwerty'
```

The configuration uses QWERTY keyboard layout. If you use Dvorak, change this to:

```toml
key-mapping.preset = 'dvorak'
```

## Workspaces

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Numbered Workspaces">
    Quick access to 9 numbered workspaces:
    
    - Workspace 1-9: `Alt + 1` through `Alt + 9`
    - Perfect for organizing by project or task type
    
    ```toml
    alt-1 = 'workspace 1'
    alt-2 = 'workspace 2'
    # ... through alt-9
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Letter Workspaces">
    26 additional letter-named workspaces:
    
    - Workspace A-Z: `Alt + a` through `Alt + z`
    - Ideal for app-specific workspaces (e.g., "B" for Browser, "M" for Mail)
    
    ```toml
    alt-a = 'workspace A'
    alt-b = 'workspace B'
    # ... through alt-z
    ```
    
    <Note>
      You can customize or remove letter workspaces you don't need.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Binding Modes

Aerospace uses two binding modes:

### Main Mode

The default mode for everyday window management:
- Focus navigation
- Moving windows
- Switching workspaces
- Layout changes

### Service Mode

Accessed via `Alt + Shift + ;` for advanced operations:
- Reload configuration
- Reset layouts
- Toggle floating windows
- Join windows
- Close all windows except current

```toml
[mode.service.binding]
esc = ['reload-config', 'mode main']              # Reload config
r = ['flatten-workspace-tree', 'mode main']       # Reset layout
f = ['layout floating tiling', 'mode main']       # Toggle floating
backspace = ['close-all-windows-but-current', 'mode main']
```

<Warning>
  Service mode commands are powerful. Use them carefully, especially `backspace` which closes all windows except the current one.
</Warning>

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Install Aerospace** on your macOS system
2. **Copy the configuration** to `~/.aerospace.toml`
3. **Start Aerospace** (or restart if already running)
4. **Learn the basics**:
   - `Alt + h/j/k/l` - Navigate windows (Vim-style)
   - `Alt + 1-9` - Switch to numbered workspaces
   - `Alt + /` - Toggle between horizontal/vertical tiles
   - `Alt + Tab` - Switch to previous workspace
