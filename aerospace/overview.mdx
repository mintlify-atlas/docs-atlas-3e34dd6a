## What is AeroSpace?

AeroSpace is a tiling window manager for macOS that automatically organizes your windows into non-overlapping tiles. It provides keyboard-driven window management, allowing you to navigate, move, and resize windows efficiently without using a mouse.

## Core Configuration

The AeroSpace configuration is defined in `~/.aerospace.toml`. Below are the key settings from the configuration:

### Startup Behavior

```toml
# Start AeroSpace at login
start-at-login = true

# Commands to run after login (empty by default)
after-login-command = []

# Commands to run after AeroSpace startup
after-startup-command = []
```

AeroSpace is configured to start automatically when you log into macOS.

### Normalization Settings

```toml
# Normalizations. See: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#normalization
enable-normalization-flatten-containers = true
enable-normalization-opposite-orientation-for-nested-containers = true
```

<Note>
Normalization automatically optimizes the window tree structure by flattening unnecessary container nesting and adjusting orientations for better space utilization.
</Note>

### Layout Configuration

```toml
# The 'accordion-padding' specifies the size of accordion padding
accordion-padding = 30

# Possible values: tiles|accordion
default-root-container-layout = 'tiles'

# Possible values: horizontal|vertical|auto
default-root-container-orientation = 'auto'
```

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Default Layout** | `tiles` | Windows are arranged in a tiling layout |
| **Default Orientation** | `auto` | Wide monitors use horizontal orientation, tall monitors use vertical |
| **Accordion Padding** | `30` | Padding size for accordion layout mode |

### Keyboard Mapping

```toml
# Possible values: qwerty|dvorak
key-mapping.preset = 'qwerty'
```

The configuration uses the QWERTY keyboard layout preset for keybindings.

### Mouse Behavior

```toml
# Mouse follows focus when focused monitor changes
on-focused-monitor-changed = ['move-mouse monitor-lazy-center']
on-focus-changed = "move-mouse window-lazy-center"
```

<Tip>
The mouse cursor automatically moves to the center of the focused window or monitor, making it easier to locate your focus point.
</Tip>

### Gaps Configuration

```toml
[gaps]
inner.horizontal = 0
inner.vertical =   0
outer.left =       0
outer.bottom =     0
outer.top =        0
outer.right =      0
```

All gaps are set to `0`, meaning windows tile edge-to-edge with no spacing between them or the monitor edges. You can adjust these values to add visual separation between windows.

| Gap Type | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Inner Horizontal** | `0` | Space between windows horizontally |
| **Inner Vertical** | `0` | Space between windows vertically |
| **Outer Top/Bottom/Left/Right** | `0` | Space between windows and monitor edges |

## Binding Modes

AeroSpace uses binding modes to organize keybindings:

- **Main Mode**: The default mode for everyday window management
- **Service Mode**: A special mode for advanced operations like reloading config, toggling floating windows, and joining containers

See the [Keybindings](/aerospace/keybindings) page for detailed keybinding documentation.
