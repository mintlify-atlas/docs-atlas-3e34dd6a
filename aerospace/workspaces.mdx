## What are Workspaces?

Workspaces in AeroSpace are virtual desktops that help you organize windows into separate logical groups. Each workspace maintains its own window layout and can be displayed on any monitor.

AeroSpace supports 35 workspaces by default:
- **Numbered workspaces**: 1-9 (9 workspaces)
- **Lettered workspaces**: A-Z (26 workspaces)

## Switching Between Workspaces

Quickly navigate to any workspace using the `alt` key combined with a number or letter.

### Numbered Workspaces

```toml
alt-1 = 'workspace 1'
alt-2 = 'workspace 2'
alt-3 = 'workspace 3'
alt-4 = 'workspace 4'
alt-5 = 'workspace 5'
alt-6 = 'workspace 6'
alt-7 = 'workspace 7'
alt-8 = 'workspace 8'
alt-9 = 'workspace 9'
```

| Keybinding | Workspace |
|------------|----------|
| `alt-1` | Workspace 1 |
| `alt-2` | Workspace 2 |
| `alt-3` | Workspace 3 |
| `alt-4` | Workspace 4 |
| `alt-5` | Workspace 5 |
| `alt-6` | Workspace 6 |
| `alt-7` | Workspace 7 |
| `alt-8` | Workspace 8 |
| `alt-9` | Workspace 9 |

### Lettered Workspaces

```toml
alt-a = 'workspace A'
alt-b = 'workspace B'
alt-c = 'workspace C'
alt-d = 'workspace D'
alt-e = 'workspace E'
alt-f = 'workspace F'
alt-g = 'workspace G'
alt-i = 'workspace I'
alt-m = 'workspace M'
alt-n = 'workspace N'
alt-o = 'workspace O'
alt-p = 'workspace P'
alt-q = 'workspace Q'
alt-r = 'workspace R'
alt-s = 'workspace S'
alt-t = 'workspace T'
alt-u = 'workspace U'
alt-v = 'workspace V'
alt-w = 'workspace W'
alt-x = 'workspace X'
alt-y = 'workspace Y'
alt-z = 'workspace Z'
```

<Note>
Lettered workspaces skip some letters that conflict with window management commands (like `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` used for navigation).
</Note>

## Moving Windows to Workspaces

Move the currently focused window to any workspace using `alt-shift` plus the workspace identifier.

### Moving to Numbered Workspaces

```toml
alt-shift-1 = 'move-node-to-workspace 1'
alt-shift-2 = 'move-node-to-workspace 2'
alt-shift-3 = 'move-node-to-workspace 3'
alt-shift-4 = 'move-node-to-workspace 4'
alt-shift-5 = 'move-node-to-workspace 5'
alt-shift-6 = 'move-node-to-workspace 6'
alt-shift-7 = 'move-node-to-workspace 7'
alt-shift-8 = 'move-node-to-workspace 8'
alt-shift-9 = 'move-node-to-workspace 9'
```

**Example workflow:**
1. Focus a window you want to move (using `alt-h/j/k/l`)
2. Press `alt-shift-3` to move it to workspace 3
3. The window is now on workspace 3, but you remain on your current workspace

### Moving to Lettered Workspaces

```toml
alt-shift-a = 'move-node-to-workspace A'
alt-shift-b = 'move-node-to-workspace B'
alt-shift-c = 'move-node-to-workspace C'
# ... (continues for all available letters)
alt-shift-z = 'move-node-to-workspace Z'
```

<Tip>
Use the `move-node-to-workspace` command to relocate windows without switching workspaces yourself. This is useful for organizing windows while staying focused on your current task.
</Tip>

## Workspace Back-and-Forth

Quickly toggle between your current workspace and the previously active workspace:

```toml
alt-tab = 'workspace-back-and-forth'
```

| Keybinding | Command | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `alt-tab` | `workspace-back-and-forth` | Switch between current and previous workspace |

**Example workflow:**
1. You're on workspace 1
2. Switch to workspace 5 with `alt-5`
3. Press `alt-tab` to return to workspace 1
4. Press `alt-tab` again to go back to workspace 5

This is particularly useful for quickly referencing information between two workspaces.

## Moving Workspaces Between Monitors

If you have multiple monitors, you can move an entire workspace to a different monitor:

```toml
alt-shift-tab = 'move-workspace-to-monitor --wrap-around next'
```

| Keybinding | Command | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `alt-shift-tab` | `move-workspace-to-monitor --wrap-around next` | Move current workspace to next monitor |

**Example workflow:**
1. You're on workspace 2 displayed on your left monitor
2. Press `alt-shift-tab` to move workspace 2 to your right monitor
3. The workspace and all its windows move together
4. The `--wrap-around` flag means it cycles back to the first monitor after the last one

<Note>
Moving a workspace to another monitor preserves the entire window layout and organization.

## Workspace Organization Strategies

Here are some common ways to organize your workspaces:

### By Project
- **Workspace 1**: Project A (editor, terminal, browser)
- **Workspace 2**: Project B (editor, terminal, database client)
- **Workspace 3**: Project C (editor, terminal, API testing)

### By Activity Type
- **Workspace C**: Code (editor, terminal)
- **Workspace B**: Browser (web research, documentation)
- **Workspace M**: Music and communication (Spotify, Slack)
- **Workspace E**: Email and calendar

### By Focus Area
- **Workspaces 1-3**: Development work
- **Workspaces 4-6**: Design and creative work
- **Workspaces 7-9**: Communication and meetings
- **Workspaces A-Z**: Project-specific workspaces

## Workspace Tips

<Tip>
**Use numbered workspaces for frequent tasks**: The number row is easier to reach than letter keys, so assign your most frequently used workspaces to numbers 1-9.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Leverage workspace-back-and-forth**: Use `alt-tab` to create a "reference workspace" pattern where you keep documentation or specifications on one workspace and your work on another.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Combine with window movement**: You can move windows between workspaces without switching to them. For example, open a new terminal on workspace 1, then immediately send it to workspace 3 with `alt-shift-3`.
</Tip>

## Multi-Monitor Workflow

When using multiple monitors:

1. **Display different workspaces on each monitor**: Show workspace 1 on your left monitor and workspace 2 on your right monitor
2. **Move workspaces as needed**: Use `alt-shift-tab` to relocate an entire workspace to a different monitor
3. **Mouse follows focus**: The cursor automatically moves to the focused window, even across monitors (configured with `on-focused-monitor-changed` in overview.mdx:46)

```toml
on-focused-monitor-changed = ['move-mouse monitor-lazy-center']
on-focus-changed = "move-mouse window-lazy-center"
```

This ensures your mouse is always near the window you're working on, regardless of which monitor it's on.
