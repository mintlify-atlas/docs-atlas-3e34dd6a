## Binding Modes

AeroSpace uses a modal system with two primary modes:

- **Main Mode**: The default mode for everyday window management
- **Service Mode**: Advanced operations like layout changes and window joining

You can switch to service mode with `Alt+Shift+;` and return to main mode with `Esc` or after executing most service mode commands.

    ## Focus Navigation

    Navigate between windows using Vim-style keybindings:

    | Keybinding | Command | Description |
    |------------|---------|-------------|
    | `Alt+H` | `focus left` | Move focus to the left window |
    | `Alt+J` | `focus down` | Move focus to the window below |
    | `Alt+K` | `focus up` | Move focus to the window above |
    | `Alt+L` | `focus right` | Move focus to the right window |

    ```toml
    alt-h = 'focus left'
    alt-j = 'focus down'
    alt-k = 'focus up'
    alt-l = 'focus right'
    ```

    ## Window Movement

    Move windows in the tiling layout:

    | Keybinding | Command | Description |
    |------------|---------|-------------|
    | `Alt+Shift+H` | `move left` | Move window to the left |
    | `Alt+Shift+J` | `move down` | Move window down |
    | `Alt+Shift+K` | `move up` | Move window up |
    | `Alt+Shift+L` | `move right` | Move window to the right |

    ```toml
    alt-shift-h = 'move left'
    alt-shift-j = 'move down'
    alt-shift-k = 'move up'
    alt-shift-l = 'move right'
    ```

    ## Window Resizing

    Resize windows intelligently based on layout:

    | Keybinding | Command | Description |
    |------------|---------|-------------|
    | `Alt+Shift+-` | `resize smart -50` | Shrink window by 50 pixels |
    | `Alt+Shift+=` | `resize smart +50` | Grow window by 50 pixels |

    ```toml
    alt-shift-minus = 'resize smart -50'
    alt-shift-equal = 'resize smart +50'
    ```

    ## Layout Switching

    Toggle between different layout modes:

    | Keybinding | Command | Description |
    |------------|---------|-------------|
    | `Alt+/` | `layout tiles horizontal vertical` | Toggle tiles layout orientation |
    | `Alt+,` | `layout accordion horizontal vertical` | Toggle accordion layout orientation |

    ```toml
    alt-slash = 'layout tiles horizontal vertical'
    alt-comma = 'layout accordion horizontal vertical'
    ```

    ## Workspace Navigation

    ### Numbered Workspaces

    | Keybinding | Command | Description |
    |------------|---------|-------------|
    | `Alt+1` to `Alt+9` | `workspace 1-9` | Switch to workspace 1-9 |

    ```toml
    alt-1 = 'workspace 1'
    alt-2 = 'workspace 2'
    # ... through alt-9
    ```

    ### Lettered Workspaces

    | Keybinding | Command | Description |
    |------------|---------|-------------|
    | `Alt+A` | `workspace A` | Switch to workspace A |
    | `Alt+B` | `workspace B` | Switch to workspace B |

    | `Alt+X` | `workspace X` | Switch to workspace X |
    | `Alt+Y` | `workspace Y` | Switch to workspace Y |
    | `Alt+Z` | `workspace Z` | Switch to workspace Z |

    <Note>
    Letters H, K, L are not bound as workspace shortcuts because they conflict with focus navigation keybindings.
    </Note>

    ## Move Window to Workspace

    ### Move to Numbered Workspaces

    | Keybinding | Command | Description |
    |------------|---------|-------------|
    | `Alt+Shift+1` to `Alt+Shift+9` | `move-node-to-workspace 1-9` | Move current window to workspace 1-9 |

    ```toml
    alt-shift-1 = 'move-node-to-workspace 1'
    alt-shift-2 = 'move-node-to-workspace 2'
    # ... through alt-shift-9
    ```

    ### Move to Lettered Workspaces

    | Keybinding | Command | Description |
    |------------|---------|-------------|
    | `Alt+Shift+A` | `move-node-to-workspace A` | Move window to workspace A |
    | `Alt+Shift+B` through `Alt+Shift+Z` | `move-node-to-workspace B-Z` | Move window to respective workspace |

    <Tip>
    After moving a window to a workspace, you'll stay in the current workspace. Use the workspace navigation shortcuts to follow the window if needed.
    </Tip>

    ## Special Workspace Commands

    | Keybinding | Command | Description |
    |------------|---------|-------------|
    | `Alt+Tab` | `workspace-back-and-forth` | Toggle between current and previous workspace |
    | `Alt+Shift+Tab` | `move-workspace-to-monitor --wrap-around next` | Move current workspace to next monitor |

    ```toml
    alt-tab = 'workspace-back-and-forth'
    alt-shift-tab = 'move-workspace-to-monitor --wrap-around next'
    ```

    ## Enter Service Mode

    | Keybinding | Command | Description |
    |------------|---------|-------------|
    | `Alt+Shift+;` | `mode service` | Enter service mode for advanced operations |

    ```toml
    alt-shift-semicolon = 'mode service'
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Service Mode">
    ## Entering Service Mode

    Press `Alt+Shift+;` from main mode to enter service mode.

    ## Service Mode Commands

    Service mode provides advanced window management operations. Most commands automatically return you to main mode after execution.

    | Keybinding | Command | Description |
    |------------|---------|-------------|
    | `Esc` | `reload-config`, `mode main` | Reload configuration and return to main mode |
    | `R` | `flatten-workspace-tree`, `mode main` | Reset layout by flattening workspace tree |
    | `F` | `layout floating tiling`, `mode main` | Toggle between floating and tiling layout |
    | `Backspace` | `close-all-windows-but-current`, `mode main` | Close all windows except the focused one |

    ```toml
    [mode.service.binding]
    esc = ['reload-config', 'mode main']
    r = ['flatten-workspace-tree', 'mode main']
    f = ['layout floating tiling', 'mode main']
    backspace = ['close-all-windows-but-current', 'mode main']
    ```

    ## Window Joining

    Join the current window with another window in a specific direction, creating a tabbed container:

    | Keybinding | Command | Description |
    |------------|---------|-------------|
    | `Alt+Shift+H` | `join-with left`, `mode main` | Join with window on the left |
    | `Alt+Shift+J` | `join-with down`, `mode main` | Join with window below |
    | `Alt+Shift+K` | `join-with up`, `mode main` | Join with window above |
    | `Alt+Shift+L` | `join-with right`, `mode main` | Join with window on the right |

    ```toml
    alt-shift-h = ['join-with left', 'mode main']
    alt-shift-j = ['join-with down', 'mode main']
    alt-shift-k = ['join-with up', 'mode main']
    alt-shift-l = ['join-with right', 'mode main']
    ```

    <Note>
    In service mode, the same Alt+Shift+H/J/K/L keybindings perform different actions (joining windows) compared to main mode (moving windows).
    </Note>

    ## Common Service Mode Workflows

    ### Reset Layout
    1. Press `Alt+Shift+;` to enter service mode
    2. Press `R` to flatten the workspace tree and reset layout
    3. Automatically returns to main mode

    ### Toggle Floating Window
    1. Press `Alt+Shift+;` to enter service mode
    2. Press `F` to toggle floating mode for current window
    3. Automatically returns to main mode

    ### Reload Configuration
    1. Press `Alt+Shift+;` to enter service mode
    2. Press `Esc` to reload config and return to main mode

    <Tip>
    Service mode is perfect for operations you don't perform frequently but need quick access to when required.

## Keyboard Layout

The configuration uses QWERTY keyboard layout by default:

```toml
key-mapping.preset = 'qwerty'
```

If you use Dvorak, change this to `'dvorak'` in your configuration.

## Available Modifiers

AeroSpace supports the following modifier keys:
- `cmd` - Command key
- `alt` - Option/Alt key (primary modifier used in this config)
- `ctrl` - Control key
- `shift` - Shift key
