## What is Alacritty?

Alacritty is a cross-platform, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator written in Rust. It focuses on simplicity and performance, leveraging the GPU for rendering to provide a smooth and responsive terminal experience.

## Configuration File

Alacritty uses TOML for configuration. The main configuration file is located at `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`.

```toml alacritty.toml
general.import = [
    "~/.config/alacritty/themes/themes/coolnight.toml"
]
[ env ]
TERM = "xterm-256color"

[window]
padding.x = 10
padding.y = 10

decorations = "Buttonless"
opacity = 0.8
blur = true
startup_mode = "Maximized"
[font]
normal.family = "0xProto Nerd Font Mono"

#regular
size = 16
```

## Key Configuration Settings

### Font Configuration

The configuration uses **0xProto Nerd Font Mono** at size 16:

```toml
[font]
normal.family = "0xProto Nerd Font Mono"
size = 16
```

Nerd Fonts include additional glyphs and icons useful for modern terminal applications and shell prompts.

### Window Settings

The window configuration provides a clean, modern appearance:

```toml
[window]
padding.x = 10
padding.y = 10
decorations = "Buttonless"
opacity = 0.8
blur = true
startup_mode = "Maximized"
```

- **Padding**: 10px on both X and Y axes for comfortable spacing
- **Decorations**: Set to "Buttonless" for a minimal window frame
- **Opacity**: 0.8 for slight transparency
- **Blur**: Enabled for a modern frosted glass effect
- **Startup Mode**: Maximized by default

### Theme Import

Themes are imported using the `general.import` directive:

```toml
general.import = [
    "~/.config/alacritty/themes/themes/coolnight.toml"
]
```

This allows for easy theme switching without modifying the main configuration. See the [Themes](/alacritty/themes) section for available options.

### Environment Variables

The `TERM` environment variable is set to `xterm-256color` for proper color support:

```toml
[ env ]
TERM = "xterm-256color"
```

This ensures compatibility with applications that depend on 256-color terminal support.

## Performance

Alacritty's GPU acceleration provides:
- Fast rendering of large amounts of text
- Smooth scrolling
- Low latency input handling
- Efficient memory usage

The combination of Rust's performance characteristics and GPU rendering makes Alacritty one of the fastest terminal emulators available.
