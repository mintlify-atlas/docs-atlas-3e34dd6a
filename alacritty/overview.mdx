## What is Alacritty?

Alacritty is a modern, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator written in Rust. It's designed to be the fastest terminal emulator available, leveraging the GPU for rendering to provide a smooth and responsive experience.

## Why Alacritty?

### Performance
Alacritty uses OpenGL for rendering, making it significantly faster than traditional CPU-based terminal emulators. This results in smooth scrolling, quick text rendering, and minimal input latency.

### Simplicity
Unlike some terminal emulators, Alacritty doesn't include built-in tabs, splits, or session management. Instead, it focuses on being a fast, reliable terminal that works well with terminal multiplexers like tmux or window managers.

### Configuration
Alacritty is configured through a single TOML file, making it easy to version control and share your configuration. The configuration format is straightforward and well-documented.

### Cross-Platform
Alacritty works consistently across macOS, Linux, and Windows, providing the same high-performance experience on all platforms.

## Configuration Approach

This dotfiles configuration customizes Alacritty with:

- **Environment variables** for proper terminal compatibility
- **Window settings** including padding, opacity, and blur effects
- **Font configuration** using 0xProto Nerd Font Mono
- **Theme system** with the coolnight color scheme

<Note>
Alacritty uses TOML format for configuration (not YAML) as of version 0.13+. This provides better type safety and more robust configuration parsing.
