## What is Tmux?

Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to manage multiple terminal sessions from a single window. It enables you to:

- Split your terminal into multiple panes
- Create and manage multiple windows
- Detach and reattach sessions (persistent terminal sessions)
- Share terminal sessions with others

## Configuration Approach

This tmux configuration focuses on:

- **Vim-like keybindings** for intuitive navigation and copy mode
- **Custom prefix key** (C-Space instead of default C-b) for ergonomics
- **Modern terminal support** with true color (RGB) and italics
- **Mouse support** for convenient window/pane management
- **Sensible defaults** like window renumbering and 1-based indexing

## Key Features

### Vi Mode
Copy mode uses Vim keybindings for navigation and text selection, making it natural for Vim users.

### Custom Prefix
The prefix key is remapped from `C-b` to `C-Space` for easier access and reduced finger strain.

### Mouse Support
Mouse support is enabled, allowing you to:
- Click to select panes
- Drag to resize panes
- Scroll through history

### True Color Support
Properly configured for 256-color and true color (RGB) support in modern terminals.
