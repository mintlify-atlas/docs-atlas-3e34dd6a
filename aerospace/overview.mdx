## What is AeroSpace?

AeroSpace is a tiling window manager for macOS that automatically organizes your windows into efficient layouts. Unlike the traditional stacking window manager in macOS, AeroSpace tiles windows side-by-side, maximizing screen space and reducing the need for manual window management.

## Why Use a Tiling Window Manager?

Tiling window managers offer several advantages for power users:

- **Efficient Screen Usage**: Windows automatically resize to fill available space
- **Keyboard-Driven Workflow**: Navigate and manage windows without touching the mouse
- **Multi-Monitor Support**: Seamlessly manage windows across multiple displays
- **Workspace Organization**: Organize applications by project, context, or task
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Consistent layouts mean less time arranging windows

## Configuration Structure

The AeroSpace configuration is stored in `~/.aerospace.toml` and uses TOML format. The configuration includes:

- **Startup Settings**: Commands to run after login and startup
- **Normalization Rules**: How windows are organized in containers
- **Layout Settings**: Default layouts and orientation
- **Gaps Configuration**: Spacing between windows and monitors
- **Binding Modes**: Keybindings for main and service modes
- **Workspace Assignments**: Custom workspace configurations

## Key Features Enabled

### Normalization

```toml
enable-normalization-flatten-containers = true
enable-normalization-opposite-orientation-for-nested-containers = true
```

Normalization ensures consistent window layouts by automatically flattening nested containers and adjusting orientations for better space utilization.

### Layout System

```toml
default-root-container-layout = 'tiles'
default-root-container-orientation = 'auto'
accordion-padding = 30
```

AeroSpace supports two primary layouts:
- **Tiles**: Traditional tiling layout where windows share space equally
- **Accordion**: Stacked layout with padding between windows

The `auto` orientation automatically chooses horizontal for wide monitors and vertical for tall monitors.

### Mouse Follows Focus

```toml
on-focused-monitor-changed = ['move-mouse monitor-lazy-center']
on-focus-changed = "move-mouse window-lazy-center"
```

When you switch focus to a different window or monitor, the mouse cursor automatically follows, creating a seamless multi-monitor experience.

### Gaps

```toml
[gaps]
inner.horizontal = 0
inner.vertical =   0
outer.left =       0
outer.bottom =     0
outer.top =        0
outer.right =      0
```

This configuration uses no gaps between windows for maximum screen space. You can customize these values to add spacing if desired.
