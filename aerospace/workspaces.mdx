## Understanding Workspaces

Workspaces in AeroSpace are virtual desktops that let you organize windows by project, context, or task. Unlike macOS Spaces, AeroSpace workspaces are keyboard-driven and support both numbered and lettered naming schemes.

## Workspace System

This configuration provides 31 total workspaces:

- **Numbered workspaces**: 1-9 (9 workspaces)
- **Lettered workspaces**: A-Z excluding H, J, K, L (22 workspaces)

<Note>
Letters H, J, K, L are reserved for focus navigation keybindings and are not available as workspace shortcuts.
</Note>

### Numbered Workspaces (1-9)

```toml
alt-1 = 'workspace 1'
alt-2 = 'workspace 2'
alt-3 = 'workspace 3'
# ... through alt-9
```

Numbered workspaces are ideal for:
- Frequently accessed applications
- Context switching between main projects
- Following conventional workspace numbering

### Lettered Workspaces (A-Z)

```toml
alt-a = 'workspace A'
alt-b = 'workspace B'
alt-c = 'workspace C'
# ... through alt-z (excluding h, j, k, l)
```

Lettered workspaces provide:
- Mnemonic naming (e.g., M for Mail, B for Browser)
- Additional workspace capacity beyond 1-9
- Semantic organization by application or project name

## Workspace Navigation

### Switch to Workspace

Navigate to any workspace using `Alt+[key]`:

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|--------|
| `Alt+1` through `Alt+9` | Switch to numbered workspace |
| `Alt+A` through `Alt+Z` | Switch to lettered workspace |

<Tip>
Develop muscle memory by assigning consistent applications to the same workspaces. For example, always use workspace 1 for your terminal, workspace 2 for your editor.
</Tip>

### Move Window to Workspace

Move the currently focused window to any workspace using `Alt+Shift+[key]`:

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|--------|
| `Alt+Shift+1` through `Alt+Shift+9` | Move window to numbered workspace |
| `Alt+Shift+A` through `Alt+Shift+Z` | Move window to lettered workspace |

```toml
alt-shift-1 = 'move-node-to-workspace 1'
alt-shift-a = 'move-node-to-workspace A'
# etc.
```

<Note>
Moving a window to another workspace does not automatically switch your focus to that workspace. Use workspace navigation to follow the window if needed.
</Note>

## Workspace Back-and-Forth

Quickly toggle between your current workspace and the previously active one:

```toml
alt-tab = 'workspace-back-and-forth'
```

**Keybinding**: `Alt+Tab`

### Example Workflow

1. You're working in workspace 1 (terminal)
2. Switch to workspace 2 (editor) with `Alt+2`
3. Press `Alt+Tab` to return to workspace 1
4. Press `Alt+Tab` again to return to workspace 2

This is extremely useful for:
- Copying code from one application to another
- Referencing documentation while coding
- Checking terminal output while editing

<Tip>
Combine workspace-back-and-forth with window movement: move a window to another workspace, press `Alt+Tab` to follow it, arrange the window, then press `Alt+Tab` to return.
</Tip>

## Move Workspace to Monitor

Move the entire current workspace to the next monitor:

```toml
alt-shift-tab = 'move-workspace-to-monitor --wrap-around next'
```

**Keybinding**: `Alt+Shift+Tab`

The `--wrap-around` flag means:
- If you're on the last monitor, it wraps to the first monitor
- Perfect for quickly reorganizing workspaces across multiple displays

### Multi-Monitor Workflow Example

With two monitors:

1. You have workspace 1 on Monitor A and workspace 2 on Monitor B
2. Press `Alt+Shift+Tab` while in workspace 1
3. Workspace 1 moves to Monitor B
4. Workspace 2 automatically moves to Monitor A to fill the space

## Workspace Organization Strategies

### Strategy 1: By Application Type

| Workspace | Purpose | Applications |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Terminal | iTerm2, Terminal |
| 2 | Editor | VS Code, Neovim |
| 3 | Browser | Safari, Chrome |
| 4 | Communication | Slack, Discord |
| 5 | Email | Mail, Thunderbird |

### Strategy 2: By Project

| Workspace | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| A | Project Alpha - all related windows |
| B | Project Beta - all related windows |
| C | Project Charlie - all related windows |

### Strategy 3: Hybrid Approach

| Workspace | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| 1-9 | Persistent applications (terminal, editor, browser, etc.) |
| A-Z | Temporary project-specific workspaces |

<Tip>
Start with a simple scheme and evolve it based on your workflow. Don't feel obligated to use all 35 workspaces immediately.
</Tip>

## Workspace Best Practices

### Keep Related Windows Together

Group all windows for a specific task or project in the same workspace. This reduces context switching and keeps your mental model clean.

### Use Mnemonic Names

Choose lettered workspaces that match your application names:
- **M** for Mail
- **S** for Slack
- **B** for Browser
- **T** for Terminal (if not using workspace 1)

### Establish Conventions

Develop personal conventions for numbered workspaces:
- Workspace 1: Always your primary development environment
- Workspace 9: Scratch workspace for temporary tasks
- Workspace 5: Always communication tools

### Empty Workspaces Are Okay

You don't need to populate every workspace. Think of them as available parking spots - use them when needed.

### Combine with Layout Commands

Each workspace maintains its own layout state. You can have:
- Workspace 1 in tiles layout with horizontal orientation
- Workspace 2 in accordion layout with vertical orientation
- Workspace 3 in floating layout

## Configuration Example

Here's a snippet showing how workspaces are configured:

```toml
# Switch to workspace
alt-1 = 'workspace 1'
alt-a = 'workspace A'

# Move window to workspace
alt-shift-1 = 'move-node-to-workspace 1'
alt-shift-a = 'move-node-to-workspace A'

# Workspace navigation
alt-tab = 'workspace-back-and-forth'
alt-shift-tab = 'move-workspace-to-monitor --wrap-around next'
```

## Advanced: Workspace-to-Monitor Assignment

While not configured in this setup, AeroSpace supports forcing specific workspaces to specific monitors using `workspace-to-monitor-force-assignment`. This is useful if you always want certain workspaces on specific displays.

See the [official AeroSpace guide](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#assign-workspaces-to-monitors) for more information.
